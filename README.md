# RadonKA
A simple but still decently fast Radon and IRadon transform based on [KernelAbstractions.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/KernelAbstractions.jl).

# Quick Overview
* For 2D and 3D arrays 
* parallel `radon` and `iradon`
* parallel exponential `radon` and `iradon`
* It is restricted to the incircle of radius `N รท 2 - 1` if the array has size `(N, N, N_z)`
* based on [KernelAbstractions.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGPU/KernelAbstractions.jl)
* tested on `CPU()` and `CUDABackend`
