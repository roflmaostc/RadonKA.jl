    RadonParallelCircle(N, in_height, weights)

- `N` is the size of the first and second dimension of the input array for `radon`.

- `in_height` is a vector or a range indicating the positions of the detector with respect to the midpoint which is located at `N รท 2 + 1`. The rays travel along straight parallel paths through the array.

For example, for an array of size `N=10` the default definition is: `RadonParallelCircle(10, -4:4)`
So the resulting sinogram has the shape: `(9, length(angles), size(array, 3))`.

- `weights` can weight each of the rays with different strength. Per default `weights = 0 .* in_height .+ 1`

    RadonFlexibleCircle(N, in_height, out_height, weights)

- `N` is the size of the first and second dimension of the input for `radon`.
- `in_height` is a vector or range indicating the vertical positions of the rays entering the circle with respect to the midpoint which is located at `N รท 2 + 1`.
- `out_height` is a vector or range indicating the vertical positions of the rays exiting the circle with respect to the midpoint which is located at `N รท 2 + 1`.


One definition could be: `RadonFlexibleCircle(10, -4:4, zeros((9,)))`
It would describe rays which enter the circle at positions `-4:4` but all of them would focus at the position 0 when leaving the circle.
This is an extreme form of fan beam tomography.

- `weights` can weight each of the rays with different strength. Per default `weights = 0 .* in_height .+ 1`
