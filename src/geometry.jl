    RadonParallelCircle(N, in_height)

`N` is the size of the first and second dimension of the array.
`in_height` is a vector or range indicating the positions of the detector
with respect to the midpoint which is located at `N รท 2 + 1`.

So an array of size `N=10` the default definition is: `RadonParallelCircle(10, -4:4)`
So the resulting sinogram has the shape: `(9, length(angles), size(array, 3))`

    RadonFlexibleCircle(N, in_height, out_height)

`N` is the size of the first and second dimension of the array.
`in_height` is a vector or range indicating the vertical positions of the rays entering the circle 
with respect to the midpoint which is located at `N รท 2 + 1`.
`out_height` is a vector or range indicating the vertical positions of the rays exiting the circle 
with respect to the midpoint which is located at `N รท 2 + 1`.

One definition could be: `RadonFlexibleCircle(10, -4:4, zeros((9,)))`
It would describe rays which enter the circle at positions `-4:4` but all of them would focus at the position 0 when leaving the circle.
This is an extreme form of cone beam tomography.
